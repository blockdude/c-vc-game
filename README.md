Game.

## TODO
* Finish implimenting util data structures ( not important )
    - state machine
    - linkedlist
    - hashset
    - hashmap
    - quadtree
    - kdtree

* For kdtree I mainly want to just update it to make it clearer
    and finish implimenting the rest of the funcitonality

* Create a mesh_upload function that creates a vao and vbo for a
    mesh so that code is neater.

* Create a mesh_render function that renders the mesh after you
    have uploaded it to the gpu so you don't have to call glDraw
    directly.

* Renderer
    - Draw function for ship and space bodies

* Test the new camera functions and see if they work

* Make a minecraft clone?
